1. different from 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock, the value at here could be negative
The difficult part of this problem is figuring out when a negative number is "worth" keeping in a subarray. 
note current_array_sum and max_sum are updated seperately for the special case [-2, -1]
2. infinity in python: float('inf') or float('-inf')

class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)

        current_array_sum = 0
        max_sum = nums[0]
        
        for i in range(n):
            current_array_sum += nums[i]
            
            if current_array_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_array_sum
                
            if current_array_sum < 0:
                current_array_sum = 0
        
        return max_sum
